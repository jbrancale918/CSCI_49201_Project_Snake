# CSCI_49201_Project_Snake

This is a simple snakes game. as the player "snake" collects points, it grows in length. if the player "snake" atempts to cross paths with itself,
it will result in a game over, and the program will close

Use the makefile to compile (command: make)

This project uses a lot of the code from the examples given on blackboard https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-41659448-dt-content-rid-344727816_1/xid-344727816_1
as this was essentially the only resource I could find for tsdl. Im not sure if I was looking in the wrong places, but it is what it is. The result is that this code is essentailly a modified form of one of the 
examples, leaving a lot of the underlying tsdl code intact. Most new parts of the code are focused in specific places that I will go into further detail in my written report
